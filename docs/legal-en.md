The User undertakes to use the Website appropriately, in accordance with applicable law, good faith, public order, accepted customs, and these terms. Use of the Website for unlawful purposes or purposes harmful to QTG and/or any third party is prohibited.

LIABILITY
QTG implements reasonable and proportionate technical and organizational measures to maintain the proper functioning of the Website and the security of information, aimed at preserving its integrity, confidentiality, and availability. Nevertheless, the User understands and accepts that using internet-based services entails certain technical risks that cannot be completely eliminated.
Accordingly, QTG does not guarantee the availability, continuity, or infallibility of the Website or its contents. QTG may temporarily interrupt access for maintenance, updates, improvements, security, or circumstances requiring it (including incidents involving third-party hosting, communications, or infrastructure providers), and may, at its discretion, announce such interruptions or carry them out during low-impact hours.
Without prejudice to the foregoing, QTG shall not be liable for damages of any kind that may arise from:
• Interference, omissions, interruptions, failures, or disconnections in the operation of the electronic system, the telecommunications network, or the User’s equipment due to causes beyond QTG’s control.
• The presence of malware, viruses, trojans, vulnerabilities, or any other harmful software elements on the Website or in accessible content when introduced by third parties or inherent to the use of open networks. The User is responsible for having appropriate protective tools (antivirus, firewalls, system updates, backups) to detect and mitigate such threats.
• Improper or negligent use of the Website by the User or third parties, as well as non-compliance with these terms of use.
• Decisions taken by the User based on information available on the Website, which is general and informational in nature and does not constitute professional advice. For recommendations or solutions tailored to a specific case, the User must request the corresponding specialized consultancy.
• The lack of truthfulness, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, lawfulness, or availability of third-party content and/or services that the User may access through hyperlinks (links), banners, widgets, or similar devices. Such external sites are governed by their own terms and policies, and QTG lacks effective and continuous control over them.

The User should review the relevant privacy and cookie policies; QTG assumes no responsibility for such external practices.
If the Website enables interactive areas (comments, forums, or other participation spaces), the User is solely responsible for the statements and content they publish, ensuring they do not infringe third-party rights (intellectual and industrial property, confidentiality, data protection, honor, image, and reputation) or violate applicable regulations. QTG reserves the right to remove content that is unlawful, contrary to these terms, or potentially harmful to third parties when it becomes aware of it.
QTG shall also not be responsible for security errors that may occur, nor for damages that may be caused to the User’s computer system (hardware and software) or the files or documents stored therein, as a result of: (i) the presence of malware on the User’s device; (ii) browser malfunction or the use of outdated versions; (iii) improper device or browser configurations; or (iv) incidents on the communications network.
The foregoing is without prejudice to liabilities that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law. For additional information on the processing of personal data and tracking technologies used on the Website, the User may consult the Privacy Policy and the Cookie Policy available on the Website itself. Likewise, if there are specific contractual terms relating to the provision of professional services, such terms shall prevail over these general rules where applicable.
